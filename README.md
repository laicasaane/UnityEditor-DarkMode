## Manual installation guide
- Download the `UnityEditorDarkMode.dll` from [releases](https://github.com/0x7c13/UnityEditor-DarkMode/releases)

Please do your own homework and make your own judgement. I offer this approach as a convenience for those who don't want to build a C++ project themselves.
- Copy the DLL into your Unity project and apply below settings to the DLL in the Unity Editor inspector:

    ![dll-setting](screenshot-dll-setting.png?raw=true)

  - Make sure `Load on startup` is checked which will make the DLL to be loaded on Unity Editor startup.
  - Make sure `OS` is set to `Windows` which will make the DLL to be loaded only on Windows OS.
  - Make sure only `Editor` is checked which will make the DLL to be loaded only in the Unity Editor.

- Restart Unity Editor and you are done!
- Now enjoy the immersive dark mode in Unity Editor!

## What if you don't want to add the DLL to your project?
There are few options:
- You could inject the DLL into the Unity Editor process yourself using your preferred approach.
- Use `withdll.exe` from [Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours). Create a batch script or PowerShell script to run the Unity Editor with the DLL attached like below:
    ```cmd
    .\withdll.exe /d:UnityEditorDarkMode.dll ^
    "C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2022.3.22f1\Editor\Unity.exe" ^
    -projectPath "C:\<Path>\<To>\<Your>\<UnityProjectFolder>"
    ```
- Put the DLL outside of your project and add a Unity Editor script to your project like below:
    ```C#
    #if UNITY_EDITOR_WIN // Windows only, obviously
    namespace Editor.Theme // Change this to your own namespace you like or simply remove it
    {
        using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
        using UnityEditor;

        public static class UnityEditorDarkMode
        {
            // Change below path to the path of the downloaded dll
            [DllImport(@"C:\Users\<...>\Desktop\UnityEditorDarkMode.dll", EntryPoint = "DllMain")]
            private static extern void _();

            [InitializeOnLoadMethod]
            private static void __()
            {
                #if !UNITY_2021_1_OR_NEWER
                // [InitializeOnLoadMethod] is getting called before the editor
                // main window is created on earlier versions of Unity, so we
                // need to wait a bit here before attaching the dll.
                System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(100);
                #endif
                _(); // Attach the dll to the Unity Editor
            }
        }
    }
    #endif
    ```

## How to change the theme?
After first launch, a `UnityEditorDarkMode.dll.ini` file will be created in the same directory as the dll. You can modify the values in this file to change the theme (Restart the editor after changing the values). Default values are given below:
```ini
menubar_textcolor = 200,200,200
menubar_textcolor_disabled = 160,160,160
menubar_bgcolor = 48,48,48
menubaritem_bgcolor = 48,48,48
menubaritem_bgcolor_hot = 62,62,62
menubaritem_bgcolor_selected = 62,62,62
```

## How to remove it?
Remove the DLL from your project and restart Unity Editor (You need to close the editor before deleting the DLL).

## How to build it?
- Make sure latest `CMake`, `Visual Studio` and `MSVC toolchain` are installed on your system. Then run below command in the project directory:

    ```cmd
    cmake -B build && cmake --build build --config Release
    ```
    > NOTE: You may need to add `cmake` to your system path if you haven't already.

- The `UnityEditorDarkMode.dll` will be created under the `build\Release` directory after the build finishes successfully.

## How it works?
This project is basically a stripped down version of [ReaperThemeHackDll](https://github.com/jjYBdx4IL/ReaperThemeHackDll) made by [jjYBdx4IL](https://github.com/jjYBdx4IL) with some minor modifications. If you like this project, please consider giving a star to the `ReaperThemeHackDll` project as well. Actually, his code with some minor modifications can be used to theme any legacy Windows applications that uses the Win32 title bar, menu bar, context menu, etc.

Ok, so what I have done on top of `ReaperThemeHackDll` is:
- Remove all the unnecessary dependencies of Reaper framework and plugin code since we don't need them for Unity Editor hack.
- Instead of checking the window class name of `REAPERwnd` when doing the sub-classing using `SetWindowSubclass` API, I use `UnityContainerWndClass` instead, which is the window class name of Unity Editor main window. You can get this window class name by using below Win32 API:
    ```C#
    [DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError = true, CharSet = CharSet.Unicode)]
    private static extern int GetClassName(IntPtr hWnd, char[] lpClassName, int nMaxCount);
    ```
- I have verified that the window class name is consistent across different Unity Editor versions (2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, Unity 6) so it should work on most versions. If not, you should probably make further modifications to the code to use the C++ `GetClassName` Win32 API to get the window class name dynamically at runtime.

  > **NOTE:** If you do this, it basically means this hack can be used for any Windows application that uses the default white Win32 title bar, menu bar, context menu, etc.
- A different color preset is given by default which I think looks better with Unity Editor.
- Some inrelevent code is also removed and some minor modifications are made to make it more performant and clean. You don't have to do it tho so I am not going to explain them here.
- The built dll is a standard Win32 DLL with a DllMain entry point, meaning it can be side-loaded using Detours `withdll.exe`. This has been explained in the ReaperThemeHackDll repository as well. However, one caveat is that if you run below command:
    ```cmd
    .\withdll.exe /d:UnityEditorDarkMode.dll ^
    "C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2022.3.22f1\Editor\Unity.exe"
    ```
    It will NOT work because invoking Unity.exe directly will launch the Unity Hub first. After you open the project from Unity Hub, it will launch the Unity Editor. But the context is getting lost from here. So instead of running above command, you should always give your project path as an argument to Unity.exe like below if you wish to use `withdll.exe` instead of the editor script approach:
    ```cmd
    .\withdll.exe /d:UnityEditorDarkMode.dll ^
    "C:\Program Files\Unity\Hub\Editor\2022.3.22f1\Editor\Unity.exe" ^
    -projectPath "C:\<Path>\<To>\<Your>\<UnityProjectFolder>"
    ```
